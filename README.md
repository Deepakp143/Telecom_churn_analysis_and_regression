# Telecom Customer Churn and Revenue Prediction

Short project description or introduction.

## Data Background

For this project, we utilize IBM's publicly available dataset named "Telecom Customer Churn." 
This dataset is designed to simulate a typical dataset from a telecommunications company. 
It comprises 7043 observations (rows) and 22 variables (columns) containing information about:

## Project Goals

1. Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or remain with the company.
2. If the customer remains with the company, build a model to predict potential revenue generated from that customer.

## Project Structure

The project includes Python code and Jupyter Notebook files for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
